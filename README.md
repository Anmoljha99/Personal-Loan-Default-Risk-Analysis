# Personal-Loan-Default-Risk-Analysis
Logistic regression-based model to predict loan defaults with Exploratory Data Analysis Using Python and Excel.
# 📉 Loan Default Risk Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will default on a personal loan based on information like their income, loan amount, credit history, and education level.

I used Python and a simple machine learning model called **logistic regression** to make the predictions. I also did data cleaning and created graphs to understand the data better.

 🔍 What the Project Does

- Loads real-looking loan data (like income and loan amount)
- Analyzes the data using charts (EDA)
- Builds a model that predicts if someone will default or not
- Shows how accurate the model is using a confusion matrix

---

 📊 Tools Used

- Python for all coding
- Pandas to work with the data
- Seaborn & Matplotlib to make graphs
- Scikit-learn to build the prediction model
- Excel for checking and exploring data manually
- 
 📈  Graphs Created

- How many people defaulted
- Income vs Default status
- Credit history vs Default rate
- Education vs Default rate
- Confusion matrix for model accuracy

 What the Model Uses

The model uses:
- Applicant’s income
- Loan amount
- Loan term
- Credit history

Then it predicts whether the person is likely to default (1) or not (0).
